# Heart-Disease-Analysis-and-Prediction
Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction:
DataSet from Kaggle was used for this Project
First of all some EDA was done to Analyse the Distribution and Box Plots are used to identify the Outliers
After that some PreProcessing was done to seperate Dependent and Independent variables in the DataSet and I used Hot One Encoding scheme for Nominal Variables. After that i did some feature scaling. I tried Normalization and Standardization both but Standardization was the perfect in this case.
For Training the Model I used Logistic Regresion with 80,20 train to test ratio.
Accuracy achieved was 90%.
